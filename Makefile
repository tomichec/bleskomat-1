## Usage
#
#   $ make install     # run install process(es)
#   $ make compile     # compile the device firmware
#   $ make upload      # compile then upload the device firmware
#   $ make monitor     # start the serial monitor
#   $ make server      # start an instance of the HTTP server
#

## Variables
DEVICE=./device
SERVER=./server

CONFIG=$(SERVER)/config.json

## Targets
#
# The format goes:
#
#   target: list of dependencies
#     commands to build target
#
# If something isn't re-compiling double-check the changed file is in the
# target's dependencies list.

## Phony targets - these are for when the target-side of a definition
# (such as "install" below) isn't a file but instead a just label. Declaring
# it as phony ensures that it always run, even if a file by the same name
# exists.
